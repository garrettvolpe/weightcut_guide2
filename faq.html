    <summary>How much weight should I cut?</summary>
    <h4>There are a few factors to determine how much weight you should cut:</h4>
    <ul>
      <ul><strong>Genetics:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Perspiration:</strong> Some people just sweat more and have an easier time shedding water
            weight.
            If
            you're the
            kind of person who starts to sweat during the first minute of warmups, you'll most likely have a much
            easier
            time shedding weight in the sauna and/or hot bath!</li>
          <li><strong>Body-Type(somatotype):</strong> Are You an Ectomorph, Endomorph, or a Mesomorph? <a
              href="https://wellnessed.com/body-types/" target="_blank">(You can read this article to find out your
              type!)</a> In general, ectomorphs will have an easier time dropping weight in the beginning of the weight
            cut
            when calorie reduction is the focus. Endomorphs and mesomorphs should have an easier time in comparison to
            ectomorphs to dropping water weight during the end of the weight cut.

          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>Gender:</strong> Males can cut more in general for a variety of factors.</ul>
      <ul><strong>Weight:</strong> People who are heavier can cut more because this is percentage based. For example,
        someone who weighs 230 pounds cutting down to the 205 pound weight class would be the same as someone weighing
        117 pounds cutting down to the 105 weight class. The first person is losing 25 lbs while the second is losing
        12
        lbs. Ultimately this is a 12% loss for both individuals.
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>Body fat:</strong> People with lower body fat and higher muscle mass can cut <strong>MORE</strong>.
        Muscle contains
        up
        to 75% water while fat tissue contains up to a mere 10% of water. The goal of this type of weight cut is to
        excrete as much water (safely) from the body as possible. The reason being, it is easy to regain this mass post
        weigh ins!
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The amount of weight you should cut depends on the individual. A rough esitmate for how
      much you should weigh 2 weeks before weigh-ins is <strong>6.5-8%</strong> more than your weight class.</p>

    <summary>What foods should I eat?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Greater than two weeks out from weigh-ins:</h4>
        <p>When we are this far out from weigh-ins, calories are the main focus. Using the <a href="index.html">Weight
            Cut Guide</a> to determine how many calories you will need to consume each day to stay on course. You can
          use an app like <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="_blank">My Fitness Pal</a> to track your
          food and it is strongly encouraged to use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ur6Cre" target="_blank">food
            scale</a> to measure our your food!
        <ul>
          <li>Limit the amount of junk food</li>
          <li>Minimal if any alcohol as it will affect recovery</li>
          <li>Keep eating carbs as this will fuel your training and aide in recovery</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Two weeks out from weigh-ins:</h4>
        <p>You will now start to reduce or eliminate carbs from your diet. To find out how much weight your body stores
          in
          carbs you can use the <a href="index.html">Weight Cut Guide.</a> <br>There are a few diets you can follow at
          this point but in my experience the best two are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ketogenic Diet</strong>
            <p>In a nutshell, this diet is low carb and high fat. You will begin to get your body in a state of ketosis
              over a few days where you will exhaust all the carbs (glyogen) from your body and the water weight
              associated with it. Fat will be your primary energy source so it will be imporant to consume fatty foods.
